# SEO

*Search engine optimization* **(SEO)** is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a search engine's unpaid results—often referred to as "natural," "organic," or "earned" results. In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine's users, and these visitors can be converted into customers.

## Search engines

Web search engines (like Google) automatically add new web sites to their search **index** every time they crawl the web. If your web site is new and unknown, it may take some time before your site is "discovered". Most search engines invites you to submit your site:

- [Goolge](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/submit-url?continue=/addurl)
- [Yahoo](https://search.yahoo.com/info/submit.html)
- [Bing](http://www.bing.com/toolbox/submit-site-url)

## Sitemap

An XML sitemap lists the pages of your website and the priorities of those pages. XML stands for Extensible Markup Language. Search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and Ask, an XML sitemap helps search engine robots crawl and index the content of your website more efficiently.

## Social networks

A great way to develop a following for your website is to get involved in the social networking arena. Becoming active on social networking sites will bring traffic to your site as well as develop back links. The goal of this is to get social with others on the web while promoting your site at the same time.

## Misc

The **title tag** is the most important element on any web page. If you do a ‘Control + U’ on any page, you’ll see the title tag in source code. It’s bounded by title tags.

 - [Screaming Frog](https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/) Good for capturing SEO info of a site and gives you raw data so you can analyze and identify SEO issues. There is no checklist of things to do from this tool, but I use it to give me more info about key SEO tactics.  
 - [Upcity](http://upcity.com/) It does a site/page analysis (haven’t used this tool).
 - [WooRank](https://www.woorank.com/) Same type of tool to do page analysis.

Note: *All three are pretty good, but price might be your biggest concern. Moz could be your best bet because you have everything there, but it might be a little costly.*

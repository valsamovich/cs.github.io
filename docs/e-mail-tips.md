# Tips for writing e-mail message

- Put the key message in your subject line to ensure that your reader doesn't delete your message.
- Keep your message short. Try to put all the pertinent information on the first screen.
- Cover only one topic per e-mail.
- Edit and spell-check your message before you send it.
- Never send e-mail when you're angry. A good test is to ask yourself if you would make your statement to the person's face. If not, don't send the message electronically.
- When forwarding a message, check the original subject line. Will the new reader understand the topic? If not, revise as needed.
- Include a closing. For external readers, use something simple such as "Sincerely" or "Regards." For internal messages, follow your organization's guidelines.
- Type in the recipient's address just before you click "Send." This reduces the chance that you'll send an unfinished message or a message to the wrong person.
- Send e-mails only to people who need to receive them.
